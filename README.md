--DashBoard Creation--

Here is the final dashboard which is static in nature as there was data on 4 sheets so it was not making any sense to add any slicer.

*This suggests that guests have a more positive experience when staying with Super Hosts, which may be due to their higher level of hospitality and service.*

--Challenges and learnings--

1. The main challenge posed by this project was to merge the data in a group of 5 countries as all the data were for individual countries. For this purpose, SQL query was used to do the task.
2. As all of our team members are working professionals, we were finding difficulty in managing time and the time availability of each team member is different. Firstly, we brainstormed and formed a flowchart of works that helped us to be on track. We allocated the work according to each personâ€™s time availability and task priority.

--Overall, The project can serve as a valuable resource for the decision-makers or any individual related to the behaviors of users based on their preferences and a well-informed decision can be made.
